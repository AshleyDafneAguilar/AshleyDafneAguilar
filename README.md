## 🚀 About Me  
<p>
My areas of interest include artificial intelligence, data science, mathematical optimization, and biological sciences, with a particular focus on <strong>immunology</strong> and <strong>neurology</strong>. My goal is to integrate these disciplines to develop innovative projects that advance knowledge in biological sciences, using optimization tools as a key support.

My topics of interest are artificial intelligence, data science, discrete and continuous probability, inferential and multivariate statistics, genetic algorithms, evolutionary computation and biological sciences; specifically immunology. My goal is to carry out projects where these topics are combined.

Technologies and Tools: Python, Bash, SQL, R, QGIS, Git, GitHub and I work with Linux and Windows operating systems.

I have participated in several projects together with researchers from UNAM, ENES Morelia: 
1. Taller Futuros posibles, a proposal to induce high school women to the area of artificial intelligence and data science.
2. Development of teaching materials for Machine Learning class, taught in the fourth semester of the career in IT.
3. Member of the emerging network of care for enesianas, an initiative to map risk areas around the campus. 
4. Also, I have been part of the in-person training June 2023 of the Michoacán Mathematics Olympiad to choose the representative selection.

I attended the course-workshop for coaches of the Mexican Mathematics Olympiad at CIMAT, Guanajuato.
I was involved in the development of the Mexican Mathematical Kangaroo 2024 web page.

Some fun facts about me are:
- National Champion in Children's Athletic Fitness in 2013.
- Twelfth place in programming contest by Coder Bloom in 2022.
- Miss Petite Jerarquía Michoacán 2023.
- Member of the women's volleyball team at UNAM, ENES Morelia.
- And in my free time I am a model.
